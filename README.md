# What is the reason?
Microsoft creates a GIVE AWAY every year and put there a lot of books that you can download FREELY, but there are only option to download they one to one and not all at once in a ZIP or similar format.

# How I can get the books?
You can just use [my script](https://github.com/Edu4rdSHL/microsoft-giveaway-books/raw/master/script.sh) to download they. Write in your terminal:

```
$ curl -O https://github.com/Edu4rdSHL/microsoft-giveaway-books/raw/master/script.sh && sh script.sh
```
Or
```
$ wget -O script.sh https://github.com/Edu4rdSHL/microsoft-giveaway-books/raw/master/script.sh && sh script.sh
```

Give me a star and enjoy it.
